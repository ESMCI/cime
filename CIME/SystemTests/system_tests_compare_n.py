"""
Base class for CIME system tests that involve doing multiple runs and comparing the base run (index=0)
with the subsequent runs (indices=1..N-1).

NOTE: Below is the flow of a multisubmit test.
Non-batch:
case_submit -> case_run     # PHASE 1
            -> case_run     # PHASE 2
            ...
            -> case_run     # PHASE N

batch:
case_submit -> case_run     # PHASE 1
case_run    -> case_submit
case_submit -> case_run     # PHASE 2
...
case_submit -> case_run     # PHASE N

In the __init__ method for your test, you MUST call
    SystemTestsCompareN.__init__
See the documentation of that method for details.

Classes that inherit from this are REQUIRED to implement the following method:

(1) _case_setup
    This method will be called to set up case i, where i==0 corresponds to the base case
    and i=={1,..N-1} corresponds to subsequent runs to be compared with the base.

In addition, they MAY require the following methods:

(1) _common_setup
    This method will be called to set up all cases. It should contain any setup
    that's needed in all cases. This is called before _case_setup_config

(2) _case_custom_prerun_action(self, i):
    Use this to do arbitrary actions immediately before running case i

(3) _case_custom_postrun_action(self, i):
    Use this to do arbitrary actions immediately after running case one

            run_suffixes (list of str, optional): List of suffixes appended to the case names.
