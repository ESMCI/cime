The directory structure is expected to stay flat. The following naming schema
should be used to maintain this pattern.

Unit test should be prefixed with `_unit` while System Tests are prefixed with
`_sys`.

For example, writing unit tests for CIME/foo.py would map to
CIME/tests/test_unit_foo.py and CIME/SystemTests/bar.py would map to
CIME/tests/test_sys_bar.py.

There are a few methods you can use to run the unit tests here:

Both `scripts_regression_tests.py` and `pytest` support the same CLI arguments.
See `--help` using either command.

- Using `scripts_regression_tests.py` from scripts/tests, run:

  `./scripts_regression_tests.py`

  This runs all the unit and sys tests.

  `./scripts_regression_tests.py test_unit_doctest`

  This runs a specific test file.

  `./scripts_regression_tests.py test_unit_doctest.TestDocs`

  This runs a specific test class.

  `./scripts_regression_tests.py test_unit_doctest.TestDocs.test_lib_docs`

  This runs a specific test case.

- Using `pytest` from scripts/tests, run:

  `pytest`

  This runs all the unit and sys tests.

  `pytest test_unit_doctest.py`

  This runs a specific test file.

  `pytest test_unit_doctest::TestDocs`

  This runs a specific test class.

  `pytest test_unit_doctest::TestDocs::test_lib_docs`

  This runs a specific test case.
