# CIME
The Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth (CIME - pronounced “SEAM”) provides two core features; a Case Control System (CCS) for configuring, compiling and executing Earth System Models, and a framework for system testing an Earth System Model.

> CIME does **not** contain the source code for any Earth System Model drivers or components. It is typically included alongside the source code of a host model. However, CIME does include pointers to external repositories that contain drivers, data models and other test components. These external components can be easily assembled to facilitate end-to-end system tests of the CIME infrastructure, which are defined in the CIME repository.

CIME is currently used by:
- [Community Earth System Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)
- [Energy Exascale Earth System Model](https://eesm.science.energy.gov/projects/energy-exascale-earth-system-model-e3sm)
