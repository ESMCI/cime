     Purpose: abstract out the parts of run scripts that are different, and use this configuration to
     create cesm run scripts from a single template.

     batch_system:     the batch system type and version
     batch_query:      the batch query command for each batch system.
     batch_redirect:   Whether a redirect character is needed to submit jobs.
     batch_directive:  The string that prepends a batch directive for the batch system.
     jobid_pattern:    A perl regular expression used to filter out the returned job id from a
                       queue submission.

 batch_system
 ===============================================================
 The batch_system and associated tags are meant for configuring batch systems and
 queues across machines.  The batch_system tag denotes the name for a particular
 batch system, these can either be shared between one or more machines, or can be
 defined for a specific machine if need be.

 Machine specific entries take precidence over generic entries, directives are appended

 queues:
 one or more queues can be defined per batch_system. if the attribute default="true"
 is used, then that queue will be used by default. Alternatively, multiple queues can
 be used.  The following variables can be used to choose a queue :
 walltimemin: Giving the minimum amount of walltime for the queue.
 walltimemax: The maximum amount of walltime for a queue.
 nodemin:      The minimum node count required to use this queue.
 nodemax:      The maximum node count required to use this queue.
 jobmin:      The minimum task count required to use this queue. This should only rarely be used to select queues that only use a fraction of a node. This cannot be used in conjuction with nodemin.
 jobmax:      The maximum task count required to use this queue. This should only rarely be used to select queues that only use a fraction of a node. This cannot be used in conjuction with nodemax.
