<namelist_definition>

<!-- Each namelist variable is defined in an <entry> element.  The
     content of the element is the documentation of how the variable is
     used.  Other aspects of the variable's definition are expressed as
     attributes of the <entry> element.  Note that it is an XML requirement
     that the attribute values are enclosed in quotes.  The attributes are:

     id
          The variable's name.  *** N.B. *** The name must be lower case.
          The module convert all namelist variable names to lower case
          since Fortran is case insensitive.

     type
          An abbreviation of the fortran declaration for the variable.
	  Valid declarations are:

          char*n
	  integer
	  logical
	  real

	  Any of these types may be followed by a comma separated list of
	  integers enclosed in parenthesis to indicate an array.

	  The current namelist validation code only distinquishes between
	  string and non-string types.

     input_pathname
          Only include this attribute to indicate that the variable
          contains the pathname of an input dataset that resides in the
          CIME inputdata directory tree.

	  The recognized values are
           "abs"  - an absolute  pathname is required
	   "rel:var_name"  - the  pathname is relative and that
            the namelist variable "var_name" contains the absolute
	    root directory.
           "mapping" - the absolute inputdata path is specified and
            will be included in the cpl.inputdata_list

     category
          A category assigned for organizing the documentation.

     group
          The namelist group that the variable is declared in.

     valid_values
          This is an optional attribute that is mainly useful for variables
          that have only a small number of allowed values.
