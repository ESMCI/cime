HOW TO BUILD
============

(1) $ cd src
(2) $ ../../../../configure --macros-format Makefile --mpilib mpi-serial
Bash users:
(3) $ (. ./.env_mach_specific.sh ; gmake)
csh users:
(3) $ (source ./.env_mach_specific.csh ; gmake)

Note: in the second step, you may need to include "--machine [machine name]",
where [machine name] is the name of the machine you are building on. In most
cases configure can figure that out on its own, but if you get an error that is
the first fix to try. Also, some machines have dedicated build nodes, so you
might need to SSH to another node before the 'gmake' step.
