Overview
--------
The ``create_test``` tool is a versatile and powerful utility provided by CIME for automating the creation, setup, building, and execution of system tests. It simplifies the process of running tests by allowing users to specify test configurations through a single command. The tool supports a wide range of test types, modifiers, and options, making it highly customizable to meet various testing needs.

Key features of ``create_test`` include:

* Automated creation and setup of test cases.
* Building and running tests with specified configurations.
* Support for multiple test types and modifiers.
* Ability to run individual tests or suites of tests.
* Integration with baseline comparison and performance testing.
* Detailed logging and status reporting for each phase of the test.

The ``create_test`` tool is essential for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the model by providing a streamlined and efficient way to conduct comprehensive system tests.

Testing a Case
--------------
To run a system test(s) CIME provides ``create_test``. This tool provides much of the same functionality as ``create_newcase`` allowing to define a non-default compiler, queue, override the output location of the test cases, etc.

CIME has functionality to create baselines fors tests, and compare future runs to track changes in answers.

The tool supports running single, or multiple tests. Multiple tests can be defined by just their test names on the CLI or by providing an XML or Python file.

.. _system_testing-individual:

Run a individual tests
``````````````````````
The following will run a single test case.

.. code-block:: bash

  ./scripts/create_test <testname>

The following will run multiple test cases.

.. code-block:: bash

  ./scripts/create_test <testname> <testname> 

These test names could also be placed a file and run with the follow command.

.. code-block:: bash

  ./scripts/create_test -f <filename>

Run a test suite
````````````````
The following will run an entire test suite of test cases.

.. code-block:: bash

  ./scripts/create_test <testsuite>

XML
:::
A pre-defined suite of test can be run by passing the ``--xml`` argument to ``create_test``.

This argument will cause CIME to load ``testlist*.xml`` files. As described in https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/wiki/System-Testing-Guide, to determine what pre-defined test suites are available and what tests they contain, you can run ``./scripts/query_testlists``.

Test suites are retrieved in create_test via 3 selection attributes::

    --xml-category your_category   The test category.
    --xml-machine  your_machine    The machine.
    --xml-compiler your_compiler   The compiler.

| If none of these 3 are used, the default values are 'none'.
| If any of them are used, the default for the unused options is 'all'.
| Existing values of these attributes can be seen by running ``query_testlists``

The search for test names can be restricted to a single test list using::

    --xml-testlist your_testlist

Omitting this results in searching all testlists listed in::

    cime/config/{cesm,e3sm}/config_files.xml

The ``./scripts/query_testlists`` tool gathers descriptions of the tests and testlists available
in the XML format, the components, and projects.

The ``--xml-{compiler,machine,category,testlist}`` arguments can be used
as in create_test (above) to focus the search.
The 'category' descriptor of a test can be used to run a group of associated tests at the same time.
The available categories, with the tests they encompass, can be listed by::

   ./query_testlists --define-testtypes

The ``--show-options`` argument does the same, but displays the 'options' defined for the tests,
such as queue, walltime, etc.

Adding a test requires first deciding which compset will be tested
and then finding the appropriate ``testlist_$component.xml`` file::

    components/$component/cime_config/testdefs/
       testlist_$component.xml
       testmods_dirs/$component/{TESTMODS1,TESTMODS2,...}
    cime_config/
       testlist_allactive.xml
       testmods_dirs/allactive/{defaultio,...}

You can optionally add testmods for that test in the testmods_dirs.
Testlists and testmods live in different paths for cime, drv, and components.

If this test will only be run as a single test, you can now create a test name
and follow the `individual <system_testing-individual_>`_ test instructions for create_test.

Python
::::::
A suite of tests can also be provided with a python file ``tests.py`` placed in ``$MODEL/cime_config``.

To run a test suite called e3sm_developer::

  ./create_test e3sm_developer

One can exclude a specific test from a suite::

  ./create_test e3sm_developer ^SMS.f19_f19.A

See ``./scripts/create_test -h`` for the full list of options.

Format
......
The following defines the format of ``tests.py``. The only variable that needs to be defined is ``_TESTS`` which needs to be a dictionary. Each key is the name of a test suite and the value is a dictionary. See below for the description of possible values.

========== ==================================================================
Key         Description
========== ==================================================================
inherit     A tuple, list, or str of other suites.
time        Upper limit for test time. Format is ``HH:MM:SS``.
share       Should cases share a build. Value is ``true`` or ``false``.
tests       A tuple, list, or str of ``<testname>``, see the format below.
========== ==================================================================

The format for ``<testname>`` is ``TESTTYPE.GRID.COMPSET[.TESTMOD]``. The ``TESTMOD`` is optional.

Example
.......

.. code-block:: python

  _TESTS = {
    "suite_a": {
      "inherit": ("suite_b"),
      "time": "0:45:00",
      "share": "true",
      "tests": (
        <testname>
      )
    },
    "suite_b": {
      "time": "02:00:00",
      "tests": (
        <testname>
      )
    }
  }

Listing the test suites
.......................
The following tool will list the tests.::

  ./CIME/Tools/list_e3sm_tests -t compsets e3sm_developer

Will list all the compsets tested in the ``e3sm_developer`` test suite.

Test name syntax
----------------
A test name is defined by the following format, where anything enclosed in ``[]`` is option.

.. code-block::
  
  TESTTYPE[_MODIFIERS].GRID.COMPSET[.MACHINE_COMPILER][.GROUP-TESTMODS]

The following is a minimal example where ``ERP`` is the ``TESTTYPE``, ``ne4pg2_oQU480`` is the ``GRID`` and ``F2010`` is the ``COMPSET``.

.. code-block::

  ERP.ne4pg2_oQU480.F2010


Below is a breakdown of the different parts of the ``testname`` syntax.

=================  =====================================================================================
Syntax Part        Description
=================  =====================================================================================
TESTTYPE           The type of test e.g. SMS, ERS, etc. See ``config_tests.xml`` for options.
MODIFIER           Changes to the default settings for the test type.
GRID               The model grid, can be longname or alias.
COMPSET            The compset, can be a longname but usually a compset alias.
MACHINE            This is optional; if this value is not supplied, ``create_test`` will probe the underlying machine.
COMPILER           If this value is not supplied, use the default compiler for MACHINE.
GROUP-TESTMODS     This is optional. This points to a directory with testmod.
=================  =====================================================================================

Test Type
``````````
The test type defines the behavior that the case will be tested against. For example a test may exercise a models ability to restart, invariance with MPI task count, or short term archiving.

CIME provides some tests out of the box, but a model may add additional test types using the ``SYSTEM_TEST_DIR`` variable or adding them to ``cime_config/SystemTests`` in any component.

The following test types are provided by CIME.

.. _system-testings-types:

============ =====================================================================================

The tests run for a default length indicated above, will use default pelayouts for the case
on the machine the test runs on and its default coupler and MPI library. It is possible to modify
elements of the test through a test type modifier.

Modifiers
`````````

              |

============ =====================================================================================

For example, this will run the ERP test with debugging turned on during compilation::

    ./scripts/create_test ERP_D.ne4pg2_oQU480.F2010

This will run the ERP test for 3 days instead of the default 11 days::

    ./scripts/create_test ERP_Ld3.ne4pg2_oQU480.F2010

You can combine test type modifiers::

    ./scripts/create_test ERP_D_Ld3.ne4pg2_oQU480.F2010

Test Mods
```````````````
The ``create_test`` tool works with out-of-the-box compsets and grids.
Sometimes you may want to run a test with modifications to a namelist or other setting without creating an entire compset. CIME provides the testmods capability for this situation.

The ``GROUP-TESTMODS`` string is at the end of the full testname (including machine and compiler).

The syntax for ``GROUP-TESTMODS`` is as follows.

============ =====================================================================================
Syntax part  Description
============ =====================================================================================
GROUP        Name of the directory relative to ``TESTS_MODS_DIR`` that contains ``TESTMODS``.

TESTMODS     Name of the directory under ``GROUP`` that contains any combination of `user_nl_*`, `shell_commands`, `user_mods`, or `params.py`.
============ =====================================================================================

.. note::

  A test mod can contain any combination of ``user_nl_*``, ``shell_commands``, ``user_mods``, or ``params.py``.

For example, the ``ERP`` test for an E3SM ``F-case`` can be modified to use a different radiation scheme by using ``eam-rrtmgp``::

  ERP_D_Ld3.ne4pg2_oQU480.F2010.pm-cpu_intel.eam-rrtmgp

If ``TESTS_MODS_DIR`` was set to ``$E3SM/components/eam/cime_config/testdefs/testmods_dirs`` then the
directory containing the testmods would be ``$E3SM/components/eam/cime_config/testdefs/testmods_dirs/eam/rrtmpg``.

In this directory, you'd find a `shell_commands`` file containing the following::

  #!/bin/bash
  ./xmlchange --append CAM_CONFIG_OPTS='-rad rrtmgp'

These commands are applied after the testcase is created and case.setup is called.

.. warning::
  
  Do not use '-' in the testmods directory name because it has a special meaning to ``create_test``.

Testing Process
------------------------

Each test run by ``create_test`` includes the following mandatory steps:

================= =====================================================================================
Phase             Description
================= =====================================================================================
CREATE_NEWCASE    Creates the case directory (case.create_newcase)
XML               XML changes to case based on test settings (xmlchange)
SETUP             Setup case (case.setup)
SHAREDLIB_BUILD   Build sharedlibs (case.build)
MODEL_BUILD       Build model (case.build)
SUBMIT            Submit test (case.submit)
RUN               Run test
================= =====================================================================================

And the following optional phases:

================= =====================================================================================
Phase             Description
================= =====================================================================================
NLCOMP            Compare namelists against baseline
THROUGHPUT        Compare throughput against baseline
MEMCOMP           Compare memory usage against baseline
MEMLEAK           Check for memory leaks
COMPARE           Used to track test-specific comparisons, for example, an ERS test would have a COMPARE_base_rest phase representing the check that the base result matched the restart result.
GENERATE          Generate baseline results
BASELINE          Compare results against baselines
================= =====================================================================================

Each phase within the test may be in one of the following states:

================= =====================================================================================
State             Description
================= ===================================================================================== 
PASS              The phase was executed successfully
FAIL              We attempted to execute this phase, but it failed. If this phase is mandatory, no further progress will be made on this test. A detailed explanation of the failure should be in TestStatus.log.
PEND              This phase will be run or is currently running but not complete
================= =====================================================================================

Output
```````
Lets look at the output from ``./scripts/create_test SMS.f19_f19.A``. Here you can find each phase of the test its status and the time it took to complete.

.. code-block:: bash

The case is created in ``$CASEDIR`` which can be seen in the output above. The test status is stored in ``$CASEDIR/TestStatus``.
The case directory name format is ``<testname>.<test-id>`` where ``<test-id>`` defaults to ``YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_hash``.
This can be overridden with the ``--test-id`` argument to ``create_test``.

The current state of a test is represented in the file ``$CASEDIR/TestStatus``. Example output::

     PASS ERP_D_Ld3.ne4pg2_oQU480.F2010.chrysalis_intel SHORT_TERM_ARCHIVER

The entire stdout output from the test will be put in the file ``$CASEDIR/TestStatus.log``.

A ``cs.status.<test-id>`` script will also be put in the test root. This script will allow you to see the status of the test.

Baselines
---------
An important part of testing is creating, comparing, and managing baselines (sometimes called gold results). Baselines can be used to compare history files, namelist files, and performance metrics.

The ``create_test`` tool can be asked to perform bit-for-bit comparisons between the files generated by the current run and the files stored in the baseline. They must be bit-for-bit identical for the baseline test to pass.

Baseline testing adds an additional test criteria to the one that comes from the test type and is used as a way to guard against unintentionally changing the results from a deterministic climate model.

Creating a baseline
```````````````````
A baseline can be generated by passing ``-g`` to ``create_test``. There
are additional options to control generating baselines.::

  ./scripts/create_test -b master -g SMS.ne30_f19_g16_rx1.A

Comparing a baseline
`````````````````````
Comparing the output of a test to a baseline is achieved by passing ``-c`` to ``create_test``.::

  ./scripts/create_test -b master -c SMS.ne30_f19_g16_rx1.A

Suppose you accidentally changed something in the source code that does not cause the model to crash but
does cause it to change the answers it produces. In this case, the SMS test would pass (it still runs) but the
comparison with baselines would FAIL (answers are not bit-for-bit identical to the baseline) and so the test
as a whole would FAIL.

Managing baselines
```````````````````
If you intended to change the answers, you need to update the baseline with new files. This is referred to as "blessing" the test.
This is done with the ``./CIME/Tools/bless_test_results`` tool. The tool provides the ability to bless different features of the baseline. The currently supported features are namelist files, history files, and performance metrics. The performance metrics are separated into throughput and memory usage.

The following command can be used to compare a test to a baseline and bless an update to the history file.::

The ``./CIME/Tools/compare_test_results`` tool can be used to quickly compare tests to baselines and report any ``diffs``.::

  ./CIME/Tools/compare_test_results -b master SMS.ne30_f19_g16_rx1.A

Performance baselines
`````````````````````
By default performance baselines are generated by parsing the coupler log and comparing the throughput in SYPD (Simulated Years Per Day) and the memory usage high water.

This can be customized by creating a python module under ``$MODEL/cime_config/customize``. There are four hooks that can be used to customize the generation and comparison.

- perf_get_throughput
- perf_get_memory
- perf_compare_throughput_baseline
- perf_compare_memory_baseline

.. TODO:: need to add api docs and link

The following pseudo code is an example of this customization.
